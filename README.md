# IOT-based-waste-bin
The Smart Waste Segregation Bin is designed to automate waste segregation at the source. Utilizing advanced sensors, it can distinguish between dry, wet, and metallic wastes, effectively sorting them into separate compartments. This system aims to promote efficient waste management, reduce contamination, and streamline recycling processes.
# Problem Statement
Task is to make a smart bin which will distinguish between different types of wastes - dry, wet or metallic using sensors. Manual segregation of waste is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often inaccurate, leading to contamination of recyclable materials. When dry, wet, and metallic wastes are not properly separated, it hinders recycling processes, increases the volume of waste sent to landfills, and negatively impacts the environment.
# Methodology
We use raspberrry pi to connect our sensors and detect the wastes accordingly. We define appropriate metrics to assess the performance of our models, such as accuracy, precision and recall. These metrics help us quantify the effectiveness of our solutions. The smart bin system will consist of a waste receptacle integrated with various sensors and a microcontroller to differentiate and sort waste into three categories: dry, wet, and metal. The system will also include mechanisms for waste separation and storage.
# Data and Preprocessing
Data Collection:
Sensors will continuously monitor the waste at the entry point. Sensor readings will be sent to the microcontroller for processing.
Algorithm for Waste Differentiation:
Step 1: Read data from all sensors when waste is deposited.
Step 2: If the moisture sensor detects high moisture levels, classify the waste as wet.
Step 3: If the inductive proximity sensor detects metal, classify the waste as metal.
Step 4: If neither moisture nor metal is detected, classify the waste as dry.
# Model Development
We make a waste bin where the waste will be thrown by people. The sensors are placed in here and the flap opens while we throw waste, is detected by the sensors and thrown into appropriate bins. A servo motor is used to open the flap. Another servo motor rotates the three bins placed as shown.
# Potential Errors
Sensor Malfunction
Error: Sensors may fail to detect or incorrectly identify the type of waste due to technical faults or obstructions.
Incorrect Waste Sorting
Error: Waste may be misclassified due to sensor limitations or overlapping waste characteristics.
Mechanical Failures
Error: The sorting mechanism may jam or fail to operate correctly due to mechanical issues or design flaws.
Power Supply Issues
Error: The bin may experience power outages or battery failures, disrupting its operation.
Connectivity Problems
Error: IoT connectivity issues may prevent the bin from communicating data or receiving updates.
# Result and Impact
The Smart Waste Segregation Bin successfully automates the segregation process, accurately sorting dry, wet, and metallic wastes with a high degree of precision.
By ensuring proper segregation at the source, the bin significantly improves the quality and quantity of recyclable materials.
The technology can be adapted and implemented in various settings, including residential areas, commercial buildings, and public spaces.
